            <h1 id="1">Description of the organization.</h1>

           <p> Our group decided to sell Computers together with its accessories via online. Maybe somebody will ask why we don’t set up a stall to sell the product? As you can see since last year 2020, the covid pandemic have made us suffer a lot, and also the cases keep rising, Malaysia government take a decision to closed down all the unnecessary shop including technology shop, so that's why it would be hard for us to set up a stall under this condition. And also because of this situation, our people have more time to stay up at home and search things online or even buy online, and this makes E-commerce grow at global level,which shouldn’t be surprising. Or maybe we could think about why we should queue up to buy the things when we can order online and no need to waste time queuing? 
            
            Retailers shouldn’t be surprised that nowadays consumers expect shopping to be as easy as touching a button.This is the main reason why we don't set up a stall but operate an online selling, the impact of E-commerce to our people, buyer or seller is greater than we operate a stall. If operating a stall or a shopping mall, we may need to pay up to a certain amount of rental fees of that place, but if we do it online we can save the money and invest it in our system. We may end up to gain double or maybe a triple of money than we spend toward the rental fees.</p>
            
            
            
            <h1 id="2">Web objective</h1>
            <P>We design this website to allow customers to buy our things online comfortably at home, and this is also for their health. The current covid situation has not improved, but more people are suffering from covid. Therefore, we intend to use this opportunity to sell computers online so as to save the time for them to go out and buy things. What's more, now that the 21st century is in the era of technology, all people have begun to rely on technology. Internet access is already people's daily routine. It is impossible for people not to touch their mobile phones for a day. I am no exception. As far as I know, young children and elderly people have already begun to learn how to use mobile phones to surf the Internet. Needless to say, everyone knows that they are teenagers. This is why we reasons for buying and selling online. Not everyone likes to go out and go shopping and buy things. In fact, there are many people like to stay at home and buy things online. These people are also known as k eyboard men. Buying and selling online can save a lot of things. For example, customers can save a lot of time. They don't need to drive to a shopping mall and wait a long time to buy what they want, while our sellers can save rent. We only sell things online. It takes some time to design web pages, write computer information and so on. In this way, people who browse our website only need to find the type of computer they want to make a transaction. We know that not everyone understands the computer equipment, so we have a message board for customers to ask their questions need to ask, and we will do our best to answer their questions. Therefore, I think it is a very good choice to buy and sell online. Maybe in the future, everyone will sell things online to do business.</P>
